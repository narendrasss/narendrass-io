# Divide and Conquer

## Quick-Sort Analysis

Assuming that QuickSort gets "lucky" and happens to alwys select the `n/4`th largest element as its pivot, give a recurrence relation for the runtime of QuickSort.

Let `T(n)` be the runtime of quicksort on an array of size `n`. Then:

```
T(n) = T(3n/4) + T(n/4 - 1) + cn
```
