# Dimension, Rank and Determinants

## Rank of a Matrix

The rank of a matrix is defined as the total number of linearly independent *column* vectors, or the total number of linearly independent *row* vectors.

To determine the rank, simply reduce the matrix to row echelon form and see how many rows are non-zero. The number of non-zero rows equal the rank of the matrix.
