Bandwidth is allocated based on need. E.g. if a user needs 1Mbps of bandwidth 10% of the time, the other 90% can be used for other users.</p>\n<p>Pros: cost-effective resource sharing.</p>\n<p>Cons: requires that peak usage &gt;&gt; average usage. If each user needs to transmit all the time, then statistical multiplexing would fail over TDM/FDM.</p>\n<p>TDM (time-divison multiplexing) and FDM (frequency division multiplexing) reserves one band for one user.</p>\n<p>TDM: Signals appear only for a short fraction of time in an alternating fashion.</p>\n<p>FDM: The band is divided into different frequencies each carrying different signals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understand-packet-switching-and-best-effort\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#understand-packet-switching-and-best-effort\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Understand packet switching and best effort.</h3>\n<p>End systems exchange messages with each other. These messages are divided into small chunks of information called <strong>packets</strong>.</p>\n<p>Packets contain a <em>header</em> that carries information for where it needs to go and a <em>payload</em> that carries the actual data.</p>\n<p>Two main types of packet switches: routers and link-layer switches.</p>\n<p>A packet switch contains links, each with an output buffer; a queue for arriving packets to wait while the link is busy with the transmission of another packet. This leads to queueing delays.</p>\n<p>If the buffer is completely full either the arriving packet or some packet in the buffer will be dropped - resulting in <strong>packet loss</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understand-circuit-switching-and-how-it-differs-from-packet-switching\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#understand-circuit-switching-and-how-it-differs-from-packet-switching\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Understand circuit switching and how it differs from packet switching.</h3>\n<p>Circuit switching reserves the resources needed along a path for communication between two end systems.</p>\n<p>The network establishes a dedicated end-to-end communication between two hosts. Removes the possibility of having to &quot;wait&quot; like in packet switching.</p>\n<h3 id=\"know-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-packet-versus-circuit-switching\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#know-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-packet-versus-circuit-switching\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Know the advantages and disadvantages of packet versus circuit switching.</h3>\n<p>Packet switching:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not suitable for real-time services like telephone and video conference calls because of unpredictable end-to-end delays.</li>\n<li>Offers better sharing of transmission capacity.</li>\n<li>More efficient and less costly to implement than circuit switching.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Users share a 1Mbps link, alternates between periods of activity and inactivity. When active, requires 100kbps of data. Chance of being active = 10%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With circuit switching, 100kbps must be reserved at all times. Thus the link can only support 10 users.</p>\n<p>Packet switching would only offer increased latency if there are more than 10 simultaneous active users. The chance that there are more than 10 simultaneous active users is very low (0.0004). Therefore 99.96% of the time packet switching would offer the same performance as circuit switching, while supporting more users at the same time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"b-protocols-and-encapsulation\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#b-protocols-and-encapsulation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> B.
